Changelog
=========


v0.1.9
------

- Replaced ``strftime(3)`` conversion specifiers ``%F`` and ``%T``
  aren't available on all platforms: replaced with long versions
  ``%Y-%m-%d`` and ``%H:%M:%S``.


v0.1.8
------

- Prevent failure in case the ``TERM`` environment variable is not set (PR #1)

  information)

  - record date
  - file name / line number
  - module / function


v0.1.5
------

- Removed dependency from termcolor (now shipping better implementation)
